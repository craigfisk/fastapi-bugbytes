# --- Alembic/Migration Specifics ---
# While Alembic version files (Python scripts) should be tracked, 
# sometimes temporary files or local testing artifacts might accumulate.
# However, usually, you DO NOT ignore the 'versions/' directory itself.
# This is just an example if you create temporary test DBs.

# --- Large Files / Data ---
# If you use Git LFS, ignore the original large files first, 
# then initialize LFS tracking.

# *.csv

# --- Secrets and Credentials ---
# Any files containing API keys, passwords, or credentials must be ignored.
